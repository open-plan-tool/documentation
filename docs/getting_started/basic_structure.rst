This repository contains the code for the user interface. The
simulations are performed by
`multi-vector-simulator <https://github.com/rl-institut/multi-vector-simulator>`__
on a dedicated server (see the
`open-plan-tool/simulation-server <https://github.com/open-plan-tool/simulation-server>`__
repository). Once a simulation is over the results are sent back to the
user interface were one can analyse them.
